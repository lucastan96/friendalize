# friendalize
Friendalize is a social media application for the introverted, and also with a fun twist!

The main objective of this project is to encourage interaction between introverted and extroverted users, or Friendalizers, by engaging in typical social media activities, and also by playing a fun game named Who's the Ghost?, which was built into Friendalize and was heavily featured in our final demonstration to the lecturers and all of the class.

Friendalize is a college project for the Universal Design Principles module. It was a team effort consisting of 4 people:

Elaine Pei Ling Chong - Project Manager, Security Tester, Back-end Programmer

Jun Chieh Tan (Lucas)(me) - UX/UI Designer, Documentation

Farwa Javed - Back-end Programmer, Documentation

Alvin Khai Ming Teo - Application Tester, Back-end Programmer
